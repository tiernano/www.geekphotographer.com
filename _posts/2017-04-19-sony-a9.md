Sony have just announced their new mirrorless flagship: the Alpha A9, and man, this is impressive!

* 24.2-megapixel full frame, using a new sensor
* shoots a total of 241 frames at 20 fps
* 694 point focal plane phase detection auto focus that can do 60 AF/AE tracking calculations per second, which sounds good... (dont ask... i have no idea either)
* ISO from 100 - 51,200, expandable to 204,800. 
* QVGA OLED Viewfinder
* 5 Axis image stablization
* 4k Video (actually shoots 6k, but oversamples... again, not sure what that all means...)
* shoots 1080p @ 120fps with full autofocus tracking too...

Price? Well, if you have to ask, as they say... ships May 25 in the US @ $4,500 and June in Europe for EUR5,300.
