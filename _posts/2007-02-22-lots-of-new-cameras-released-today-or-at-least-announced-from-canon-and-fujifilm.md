So, this morning we have no less then 8 Cameras released, 5 from Canon, and 3 from Fuji. So, without further ado, here are the links:

[Canon's EOS-1D Mark III DSLR with live LCD][1]  
[Canon debuts SD750 and SD1000 Digital ELPH cameras][2]  
[Canon's compact PowerShot TX1 captures 7.1 megapixel stills and HD video][3]  
[Canon's new PowerShot A570 and A560][4]  
[Fujifilm's FinePix A820 and A900 for consumers][5]  
[Fujifilm's FinePix S5700][6]

Of them all, the most imporant one for most photographers will be the EOS 1D Mark III, even though most could not afford it. The specs are interesting. 10 frames a second for up to 110 photos in JPEG or 30 in RAW. thats 11 seconds continous shooting in JPG! it also mentions something called a &#8220;Live LCD&#8221;. From what i have read, it seems to be the same thing you get on a low end digital camera, but better. i can actually see this being handy (Tripod shooting, or if your shooting with your camera heigher then you, but it does sound strange.

Also, the TX1 is very interesting. this is what i want to carry around with me. HD Video, 7MP photos, and its a Canon (not literally a canon that shoots people, but you know what i mean. Sorry, its early, ish, in the morning. my head doesent work correctly at this time.) Sounds interesting. could be handy for the shots where a Full SLR is too big (eg, Pub, Partys, some family outings, etc)
