I would like to set up a good online photo galery, with different things in it, as follows: 

* thumbnailed galerys (which shouldent be too hard to do, in theory)
* ability to sell photos (incase i want to)
* LOTS of meta data display, just because its handy
* backend API, so i might be able to automate the uploading of images, etc

I have seen [SmugMug][1] and Flickr (which i use a lot) but SmugMug might be a little pricey for something i may try later, and Flickr does not allow hinding versions of photos (full size, for example). Any tips? the more technical question was posted [here on my main blog][2], so if your a bit more technical, why not check it out. If you have a solution, why not email me at <tierno@lotas-smartman.net> or leave a comment.
