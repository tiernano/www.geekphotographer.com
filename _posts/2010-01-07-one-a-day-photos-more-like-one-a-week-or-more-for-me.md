So, one of the things i decided to do this new year was a [One A Day][1] type project&#8230; But after the first 6 days, i only shot on 2 days&#8230; SO, i changed my &#8220;project&#8221; to the &#8220;One a Week&#8221; project&#8230; ITs more one Galery a week, than one photo at this stage, but hopefully it will get me taking more and more photos.

The photos are currently hosted [on my SmugMug site][2]. Leave a comment on the photos if you have any.
