Check out this Apple.com tutorial showing you how to setup a [Tethered workflow in Aperture][1]. You might be wondering why you would want this and what a tethered workflow actually is. Well, with a tethered workflow, your camera does not save its photos to the memory card, but sends them via Firewire or USB to the computer directly. This allows full screen previewing of the photo a lot quicker then shooting a few photos, poping out the memory card and then uploading to the machine. and that kind of answers the why too. i have been playing with this today for a few minuites, and it seems to work well. Ideally, this should be done on a Laptop (my PowerBook may do the job well) but while trying it out im doing with on the MacPro. Anyway, check it out. Very handy for Studio shoots.
