Something i dont do that regulary is printing. i prefer soft copy of my photos, which i have on multiple devices and my website for freinds and family, and anyone else, to see. But there is the odd photo which i do want or need printing. Inside Aperture has a post showing you [how to automate printing from Aperture via Photoshop][1]. From reading the article, Photoshop talks to printers differently to the way Aperture does. More control? One of these days i will find out!
