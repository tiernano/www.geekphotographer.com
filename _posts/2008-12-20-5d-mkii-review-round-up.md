I have taken some photos with my 5D MKII, but not enough to give a proper review. i am hoping to use this a lot more over the next couple of days and weeks, and hope to show some photos taken with this eventually. but to tide you over, Engadget has a list of [reviews from around the web from the 5d MKII][1]. if anyone has questions around this, please shout and i will answer as much as i can.
