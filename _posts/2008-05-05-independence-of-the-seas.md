I was in [Cork][1] over the weekend, and while there i got some shots of the [Independence of the Seas][2]. The shoot is available [here][3] and Robert Sweetnam has a [few more here][4]. an example shot, and just to give an idea of size, check out the buses sitting beside the ship here:

The ship is 339m long, cost $590 million to build and has capacity for 4370 passangers and 1360 crew. This is one hell of a ship. it is one of the largest cruise ships and passenger vessels ever built (at the time of construction).
