It seems that the sucessor to my Canon 350D [has poped up in China][1]. Its called the 370D, has a 10.1Megapixel sensor, 21 point auto focus, 7FPS rapid fire shooting (not sure for how long, but 7 up from 3 on the 350D is quite good) both CF AND SD support. Not totally sure if this is a real info, or fake, but if its real, its very nice. See the photo below ([from Engadget][2]) and see what you think. Again, not sure the validity of this, so take it with a pinch of salt. [][3]
