Canon have announced 2 new Cinema cameras today: the Canon EOS-1D C (above to the left) and the Canon C500 (to the right). Both shoot 4K Video with the 1DC shooting 4096X2160 @24FPS to CF card and the C500 having a few more options, including 4096 x 2960 and 3840 x 2160 both at 60FPS. there is also an option to shoot at 4096 x 1080 or 3840 x 1080 at 120FPS! All those shooting options require an external recording device, but there are 2 CF Card slots included, which can be used to shoot 1080P video. There is a lot more info on the [Engadget page here][2], including the press release. Now for the interesting part. the prices. The 1DC is. Are you sitting down? Its $15K. the C500. If you have to ask you cant afford it. Well, the [C300][3] is $16K, and this will be more expensive. price not yet known, but. I know I cant afford it. Both cameras should ship by the end of 2012. If anyone gets their hands on one, leave a comment!

[**Update: 2012/04/16**] Engadget has posted 2 hands on articles with the [EOS C500][4] and the [EOS-1D C][5].
