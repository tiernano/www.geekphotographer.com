Canon have announced 2 new Cinema cameras today: the Canon EOS-1D C (above to the left) and the Canon C500 (to the right). Both shoot 4K Video with the 1DC shooting 4096X2160 @24FPS to CF card and the C500 having a few more options, including 4096 x 2960 and 3840 x 2160 both at 60FPS. there is also an option to shoot at 4096 x 1080 or 3840 x 1080 at 120FPS! All those shooting options require an external recording device, but there are 2 CF Card slots included, which can be used to shoot 1080P video. There is a lot more info on the [Engadget page here][2], including the press release&#8230; Now for the interesting part&#8230; the prices&#8230; The 1DC is&#8230; Are you sitting down? Its $15K&#8230; the C500&#8230; If you have to ask you cant afford it&#8230; Well, the [C300][3] is $16K, and this will be more expensive&#8230; price not yet known, but&#8230; I know I cant afford it&#8230; Both cameras should ship by the end of 2012&#8230; If anyone gets their hands on one, leave a comment!
