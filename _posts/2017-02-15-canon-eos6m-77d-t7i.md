Canon have announced 3 new cameras today. First, the EOS 6M, a small, mirrorless camera, which looks, well, interesting... Its been a while since i had a Mirrorless camera (had a Sony one a few years back... cant even remember the name of it!) and for me, i have no use: I either shoot on my 5Ds or iPhone... Anyway, someone out there will find the specs interesting:

* 24.2-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor
* Digic 7 processor 
* 100-25,600 ISO
* Bluetooth
* NFC
* WiFi 
* 3 inch tilting LCD
* Optional EVF (electronic View finder...)

Shipps April, and will set you back $780 body only or $900 with a lense. more at [Engadget][2] and [DPReview][1].
