[this article over at OutBackPhoto.com][1] shows you how to fake the blur of depth of field in your photos. interesting tip. i have taken photos, and though they looked good on the screen of my camera, but found out that they where not as good as hoped when i got them home. mind you, after some experimenting, i have gotten it working, kind of, but handy tip none the less.
