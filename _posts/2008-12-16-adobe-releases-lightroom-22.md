Adobe has updated LightRoom to 2.2. I am currently using Lightroom 2.2 as my main workflow suite for photos. very impressed with it, and the fact it is multi platform makes me a lot happier. I do &#8220;in theÂ field&#8221; work on my MacBook Pro, and when i get home, copy the files and their changes to the Mac Pro and continue working on them. very handy stuff.
