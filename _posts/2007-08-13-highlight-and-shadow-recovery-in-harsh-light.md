Inside Aperture has a post talking about [Highlight and Shadow recovery in harsh light][1] using Aperture. This might come in handy. I was shooting photos at a friends wedding a few weeks ago (not main photography, just some nut with a camera) and some of the shots outside need medications. I have not had a chance to look at them properly, but with this, I may get a chance in the next few days. We will see.
