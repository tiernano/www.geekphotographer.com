Sony has announced a few new full frame, and not so full frame cameras today. First up is the A99, pictured above. [NOTE: all photos borrowed from the Engadget articles, but hosted locally. I hope that linking back and leaving their logo is enough for attribution…

So, the A99 has a full frame, 24.3MP sensor, cost about $2800, has an ISO to 102,400, shoots 1080/60P video as well as 24P, 6FPS shooting of photos and has a 921k-dot Xtra Fine twilt-and-swivel LCD. More details, and some extra photos available on the original Engadget article.

Next is the Cybershot RX1. It's a compact digital camera with the same full frame 24.3MP sensor as the A99. It shoots at 5FPS, includes a 35MM F2.0 Zeiss Sonnar T* fixed prime lens, and costs $2800! EEK! Again, more details on the original engadget article.

Next, Handy cams. The Sony NEX-VG900 Handycam, Sony's first 35MM HD Video camera. Again, the 24.3MP sensor as the 2 cameras above, compatible with E-Mount lenses and shoots 1080P video at 24 or 60FPS. Also, the NEX-VG30 which has a 16.1MP APS-C sensor. Again, more info on the Engadget site. [[Sony announces NEX-VG30 and full-frame NEX-VG900 Handycams, we go hands-on](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/12/sony-nex-vg30-vg900-hands-on/)]

Last, but not least, the Sony NEX-6. 16.1MP APS-C sensor, ISO 25,600, 1080/60p video and 10 FPS shooting. It has 802.11B/G Wifi (which is a nice feature) and you can use something called PlayMemories Camera Apps, which could be interesting… So, do I need to say more?

So, all in all, looks good… I like the sound of the NEX6. I have an NEX3 at the moment, and it is a very nice camera… The NEX6 could be a replacement…
