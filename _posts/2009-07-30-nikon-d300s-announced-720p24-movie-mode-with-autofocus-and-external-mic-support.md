So, 3 new cameras announced/released today, and i was going to do one large post, but though, what the heck. 3 would be better…

First, The Nikon D300s for all you Nikonions out there&#8230;

&#160;

Cost: $1799. will shoot 24FPS video at 720p resolution. 12.3mp sensor, 7 FPS burst shooting, Dual CF and SD Card shots (one of each) but by the sounds of things the sensor (DX) is not full frame… More info on [Engadget][2] and [Digital Photography Review][3].
