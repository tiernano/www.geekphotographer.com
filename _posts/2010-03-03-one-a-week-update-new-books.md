So, just a quick update on my One (galery) a Week challange&#8230; If you have been watching [my SmugMug site][1], you will notice the last photos where uploaded on the 7th Feb&#8230; I have missed a few weeks, mainly due to lazyness&#8230; I hope to get back in the photography saddle, as it where, soon&#8230;

I have also gotten a few new photography related books in the last few days. The first is [The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)][2]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=tiescomclo-21&#038;l=as2&#038;o=2&#038;a=0321555562" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and the second is [The Adobe Photoshop CS4 Book for Digital Photographers (Voices That Matter)][3]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=tiescomclo-21&#038;l=as2&#038;o=2&#038;a=0321580095" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. I am hoping to review these and post some info about them soon. (those links are UK links, but if your interested, the US links are as follows:   
[The Adobe Photoshop CS4 Book for Digital Photographers][4]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lotassmartmann00&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0321580095" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />  
[The Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 2 Book for Digital Photographers][5]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lotassmartmann00&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=0321555562" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

just to start though, looking at the Lightroom book, its very handy. was messing with Lightroom last night using the book for reference and i have found a lot of extra stuff i did not know&#8230; very cool stuff&#8230;
