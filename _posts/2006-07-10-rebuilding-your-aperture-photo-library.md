Check out [this post over at Aperture Tricks][1] showing you how to rebuild your aperture library when it gets slow. I am having this problem at the moment. aperture takes ages to do anything. it may be my powerbook being slow (only 1Gb ram and 1.33Gz processor), it may be the hdd being slow and small (5400rpm and 60Gb) or it may be apertures library, but i think in any case, it may be all 3 <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> ahhh well, we see what happens. handy tip though.
