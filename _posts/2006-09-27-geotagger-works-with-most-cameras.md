I just found this, and i want one! Its called a [GeoTagger][1]&nbsp;which connects to the Hot Shoe (usually used for External flash) on your camera and when you take photos, it records the GPS location of where the photo was taken, which way you where facing, and some other bits and peices. then, when you get home, you use software to link the 2 together and your sorted. pretty interesting idea. i have to get me one of these!
