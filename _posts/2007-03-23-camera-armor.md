I like taking photos. and i like to bring my camera places to take photos. i only have 1 problem: Weather. When it rains, my camera does not like it. i dont mind me getting wet (i can get dry in the car) but if the camera gets wet, thats a whole different story. it might not want to work after. Well, i dont know how much weather protection [this supplies][1] but if it does, and they make one for a Canon 350D, i want one! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
