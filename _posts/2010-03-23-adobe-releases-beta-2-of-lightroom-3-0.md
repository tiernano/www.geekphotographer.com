Over the last while, i have been trying out Lightroom 3.0 beta as my main photography workflow. given i shoot RAW, and given the software is still beta, i use LightRoom's &#8220;Write changes to XMP Side car&#8221; option. this way, if anything goes wrong, i still have my originals, and i just need to remove the side cars.

Anyway, [BETA 2 has been released][1], and due to the fact i am actually writing this from my Hospital bed, i wont be playing with it for a few days (check out my [Twitter feed][2] if your actually interested). from the AdobeLabs website, here are the new features:

* **Improved performance throughout the application** for faster importing and loading of images
* **Native tethered shooting support** for select Nikon and Canon DSLR cameras
* **Luminance noise reduction** has been added to the previous color noise reduction improvements available in the first public beta for outstanding overall high ISO quality
* **Support for importing and managing video files** from DSLR cameras for better overall photographic workflow control
* **Improvements to the import experience** in the first beta to reflect public feedback
* **Improved watermarking functionality** from the first beta to reflect public feedback

Lightroom 3 beta 2 builds on the enhancements introduced in the first Lightroom 3 beta release:

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    <strong>Brand new performance architecture</strong>, building for the future of growing image libraries
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>State-of-the-art noise reduction</strong> to help you perfect your high ISO shots
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Watermarking tool</strong> that helps you customize and protect your images with ease
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Portable sharable slideshows with audio</strong>â€”designed to give you more flexibility and impact on how you choose to share your images, you can now save and export your slideshows as videos and include audio
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flexible customizable print package creation</strong> so your print package layouts are all your own
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Film grain simulation</strong><strong> tool</strong> for enhancing your images to look as gritty as you want
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>New import handling</strong> designed to make importing streamlined and easy
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>More flexible online publishing options</strong> so you can post your images online to certain online photo sharing sites directly from inside Lightroom 3 beta (may require third-party plug-ins)*
  </li>
</ul>

Things i am interested in is the Performance (nothing can be fast enough!), import improvments and the Teathered Shooting. this is a very handy feature. So, if your interested, go check it out. but be warned. BETA = not production. i am a trained profesional and one day i will regret running BETA in production.
