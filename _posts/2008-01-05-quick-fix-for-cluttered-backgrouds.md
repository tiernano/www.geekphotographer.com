this article over at PhotoDoto talks about, and shows you [how to make your photo backgrounds less cluttered][1]. Its a very nice piece and has both before and after shots, which allow you to see what has changed. there are a few photos in my collection which would need touch ups like this, and i should really play more with PhotoShop to work out how to do them.
