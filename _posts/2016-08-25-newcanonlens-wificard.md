So, not only did Canon [release the 5D MK IV][1] but they also announced 2 new lesnes and a SD based Wfii Adapter. 

First, the lenses. One above is a Canon 24-105 F4 ii, an update to one of the lenses i have myself. It now features 4-stops of optical image stabilization, up from 3, and also "ghosting and flare reduction with air sphere coating", whatever that means... available October for $1100 ([BH Link][3]).

next is the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L III USM. It now features a large diameter GMO dual-surface aspherical lens, and some performance tweaks. also available October for $2200 ([BH Link][2]).

![Canon W-E1](https://images.tiernanotoole.net/Image/?inputImage=geekphotographer/20160825-we1.jpg "Canon W-E1")

Finally, the W-E1. Canon's answer to [EyeFi][5] but without the memory. It is basically a Wifi Adapter that sits in your SD card slot and trasnfers all data over wifi. Unlike the EyeFi, there is no storage, so you need to use an CF card for storage. It is designed to work with the [7D MKII][7], the [5DS and the 5DS R][6]. Price is about $50 (i know what i want for Christmas!) and will be available in September. ([BH Link][4])
