After some thought and playing with [Phanfare][1] i decided to open a [SmugMug account][2] ($5 off link). I have installed the [Aperture Export addin][3] which makes uploading a lot easier, and there are some photos up there now. I will be adding more over time, So, check it out! I have not given up on my dream of one day building a complete, self build photo sharing site, but it will be on hold. im currently fairly busy, and insted of building the photosite, i want to take photos! [update] it would have been a good idea to include a link to the new site [tiernanotoole.smugmug.com][4].
