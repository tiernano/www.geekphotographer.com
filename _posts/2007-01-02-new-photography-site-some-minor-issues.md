Ok, so my new photography site is now Live! Check out the [Galeries][1] and see what i have been working on for the last while. most photos arent great (like my spelling) but there there for testing. More will be done over the next while. The one issue i am having is DNS. I have moved servers around a bit, so you may still be looking at the old site. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next few days.
