Last August, Samsung announced the [Samsung Galaxy Camera][1]. I posted about it [here][2] and I have had one for the last few months. Very impressive piece of kit! Well, today, there are 2 more cameras being added to the Galaxy Range.

First, we have the Galaxy NX. As the photo above, from Engadget, mentions, it has LTE and Android. It's a mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses, 3/4G capable, Bluetooth 4, Wifi, 20.3mp APS-C sensor with a 1.6Gz Quad core Pega-Q CPU, 4.8 inch HD screen and can shoot at 8.6FPS. Add into the fact that it runs the Android OS, and you are in for a treat! No word on pricing, but the UK, and hopefully Ireland, will be getting it first! US sometime after that. [Engadget have some more details][3] about the camera on their site.

Next, we have the Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom, again picture from Engadget. This is essentially a [Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini][4] with a 10X optical zoom camera bolted in. It has a 16MP point and shoot style sensor, can make phone calls (unlike the [Galaxy Camera][1]), and by looking at the photos, seems to be smaller than the Galaxy Camera. All in all, looks good. [Engadget have more on their site][5] about this too.

So, now to figure out if I should buy the NXâ€¦
