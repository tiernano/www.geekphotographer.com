![Gigapan EPIC Pro][1]

I have seen videos of this GigaPan thing online before, and the results that it creates, and i have always wanted one. For those of you who dont know what a GigaPan is, its a holder for your camera which moves around and automatically takes photos. you tell it the top most left point and the bottom most right point, and it figures out how many photos to take and takes them magically. the problem has been that they where originally for small Point and shoot camera, and DSLRs would not fit in. but not any more!

[GigaPanner.com are reporting][2] that the [GigaPan EPIC Pro][3] will be available in April. this will take a full DSLR, and looking at the photo above, has built in remote shooting support (the first one of these i seen for the Point and shoot devices had a &#8220;finger&#8221; that pressed the shoot button. the price is $895. which sounds a bit steep, but if you take massive giga-pixel photos, then it would be worth it!
