Ok, im now not very happy. i dropped my camera. Its a [Canon 350D][1], which had the [Battery Grip][2] and an 18-55mm lens on it at the time. the battery grid wont stay closed, and the camera wont go on unless i hold the little closing clip in place while i take photos, and the lens is completly f**ked. Now to try and get it either fixed or replaced. Mind you, the camera still works grand, just that lens and the battery sled. i have a sled for 6 AA batteries, which still works grand
