this is a very interesing idea. check out [This post over at Instructables.com][1] showing you how to put your Camera in a bag and use it while its in there. i dont know how water proof it would be, but its a very interesting idea. i will be building one of these for my camera, for when it starts raining. mind you, over the last few weeks, we havent had to worry about the weather in Dublin. Very nice! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
