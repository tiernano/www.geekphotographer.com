A couple of big announcements in Canon land today! First, we have the 2 monsters announced above: Ladies and Gentlemen, you are looking at the new Canon 5Ds and 5Ds R. These each have 50.6MP sensors, Dual DIGIC 6 image processors, 61 point auto focus and a built in time lapse feature. They also shoot at 5 FPS.

They also feature something called Active NFC, a wifi connection, USB 3 (which is handy with files that could be up to 50mb a piece), CF and SD support and clean HDMI out (guessing that means what you see is what you get on the output… no processing…). It shoots video at 1080P at 24.25 and 30FPS and 720P at 60FPS. 4K video would have been nice, especially when you see the price, but, Canon have their reasons…

Based on the Engadget article, the only thing different between the 2 (the R is the higher end one) is the price ($3700 VS $3900 for the R) and the R eliminates the “Low pass filter effect”. [More details available over on Engadget][2].

Also, at the same time, they also announed the lense above, the 11-24mm F4 USM. 126 degree angle of view on this thing! Mind you, it will probably cost about 3 grand…
