Its January, which means only one thing… Well, 3 things… 1) Massive credit card bills for Christmas gifts… 2) College exams (final year though! Wahoo!) 3) CES! an this post is about CES!

The Canon Powershot A2600 and A1400 Mid range point and shoots, taking over from the A2400 and A1300. A2600, costs $150, 5X 28mm zoom, 16MP CCD, F2.8-5.9 and shoots 720P video. The A1400 which is basically the same as the A1300. Both include some imaging upgrades (Smart Auto) and Eco Upgrades (30% battery increase), but the A1400 has nothing much else… [[Canon PowerShot A2600 and A1400 offer modest feature bumps, little incentive to upgrade][1]]
