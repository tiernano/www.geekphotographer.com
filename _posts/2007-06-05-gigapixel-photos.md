Docbert.org has some very cool photos, some of which are in the Gigapixel range, and very high mega pixel counts too. there are 3 in total: [Chicago by night, at a Gigapixel][1] ([tech info here][2]), [Machu Picchu][3], at a staggering 1.5GP ([again, info here][4]) and [Sydney by night, at 720MP][5] ([tech info here][6]). This is pretty interesting stuff. in the info pages, the photographer says how the photo was generated, but there are no details about if there was a special tripod or anything used to take the photos. Very cool stuff though.
