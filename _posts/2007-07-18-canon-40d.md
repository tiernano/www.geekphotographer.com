Engadget has some [sketchy info about a potential Canon 40D][1]. this would be replacement to the 30D, or with the way canon seem to do things, the 20D. I think they like having 2 cameras in a particular segment: for example, the 400D and 350D in the prosumer range, then the 20 and 30D in the Semi Pro Range, and then there are a few 1Ds (depends on if you want speed or 16MP photos&#8230;). Anyway, salt to be used as instructed&#8230;
