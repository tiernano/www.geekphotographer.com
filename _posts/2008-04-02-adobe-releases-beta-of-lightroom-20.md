Adobe has r[eleased a BETA of Lightroom 2.0][1]. the new beta supports 64bit on both Windows and OSX platforms, which for me is probably one of the biggest advances. Also, Multiple monitor support is included, which is also handy!

BETA Expires at the end of August, which either means the RTM will be soon after, or a new BETA Version.
