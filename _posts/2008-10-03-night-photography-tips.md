This video, originally posted on DSLRTips.com, and found though Digital Photography School.com has tips on how to take great night photos. Its something that i have done a few times before, with varying results. 

having the tips makes me now want to go out with my camera in the middle of the night and take random skyline photos… watch this space for the results…
