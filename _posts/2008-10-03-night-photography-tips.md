This video, originally posted on DSLRTips.com, and found though Digital Photography School.com has tips on how to take great night photos. Its something that i have done a few times before, with varying results. 

<div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:3528047a-b47f-494f-8214-682804d5c4ab" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">
  <div>
  </div>
</div>

having the tips makes me now want to go out with my camera in the middle of the night and take random skyline photos… watch this space for the results…
