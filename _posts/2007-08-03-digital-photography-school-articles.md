I havent posted anything here in a while, so i though i would add some links to articles over at [Digital Photography School][1], a really great site.

[Travel Photography Tips][2] [Video]

[Model Release Forms: A primer][3]

[4 Rules of Composition for Landscape Photography][4]

[Using flash in action photography][5]

The 4 rules have links to other articles, which are also handy, but you have to read them directly! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
