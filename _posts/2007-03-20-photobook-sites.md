in May of last year, my Sister turned 21. as a gift idea, my mum asked me to build a photobook for her. After scanning a load of photos, i then realized that i couldent work out how to get it printed. I ended up using [Apple's iPhoto][1], which worked well, but wasent great. I wanted to get some photos printed up for a friends wedding, but, as i said, the iPhoto book dident look profesional enough. Well, here are 3 different sites that could help if your in the market for a photo book:

[Blurb][2]: Looks like more then just a photo book. very interesting. you can also sell your books on their store. I havent used them, but im thinking about it

[PrintMyPhotoBook][3]: again, havent used them, but looks good.

[MyPublisher][4]: looks simular to the iPhoto books, but not sure since, again, havent used them.

Hopefully this helps! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
