All budget ones. Right, usually i would perfer posting about higher end point and shoot cameras, and nice SLRs, but, [Engadget has a list of 9 HP budget][1] cameras just released. Now, why would i be interested, when i have a grand worth of SLR and Glass in the house? Well, you cant really bring them to the Pub, or a birthday party with Drink and drunken people, especially if you will be drinking too. These are the kind of cameras which you dont mind accidentally dropping. So, check them out. cheapest is $80, most expencive is about $300.
