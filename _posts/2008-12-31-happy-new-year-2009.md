Happy new year to all my readers! just taking this time to come up with some plans for the comming year:

  * Become a better programmer: been on my list for quite some time now, but still getting there&#8230;
  * take more photos: now i got my 5D MK II, i need to use it properly&#8230;
  * Read more: even if they are tech books, i should read more, since looking at a screen too long can make you distracted&#8230; you end up reading email, or surfing the web or&#8230; ohhh shiney&#8230;

Well, they are my real plans&#8230; i could have loose weight, eat right, etc, but, who in reality is going to belive them? not me, thats for sure!

have a good one, and hope to talk to you all next year!
