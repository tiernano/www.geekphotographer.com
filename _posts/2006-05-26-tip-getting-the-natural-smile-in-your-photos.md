first tip on the blog and its from [Lifehacker.com telling you how to get natural smiles][1] on your photos:

*&#8230;count down 3-2-1-Cheese!, take one shot, and then take another shot immediately after. The smile in the first picture will often look stilted and posed, but there is usually a moment a split-second later when the model will relax and his smile will look much more natural.*

there is a second sub tip there too: 

*Usually I go with the &#8220;make dumb jokes until subject doesn&#8217;t realize you&#8217;ve taken 17 photos&#8221; approach which often nets out at least one good one, but that&#8217;s just me.*

Handy stuff. stay tuned for more!
