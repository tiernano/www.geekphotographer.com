Right, seems that the site has moved over correctly, which is always a good thing, but I have to apologize for old posts showing up in your feed reader. this is because the URLs of the blog have changed. on a happier note, comments should be working properly, so leave a comment, and tell me what you think! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
