Sony has just announced info about their new Alpha A200 camera. 102MP, 750 shot battery and 2.7&#8243; LCD. [More info from Engadget][1]. Next, Casio&#8217;s EX-F1. There was a prototype of this floating around a while back, but now its official. It shoots 60 Frames at 6PM! And also shoots video at up to 300 FPS at VGA quality. 1080i and 720p is supported, records in MP4, and has the option of 1200 FPS at 336X96. Pretty crazy camera. Price: $999. Not bad. [more again at Engdaget][2].
