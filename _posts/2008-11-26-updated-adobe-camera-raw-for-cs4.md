Adobe has released an [update to Camera RAW For CS4][1]. this is just in time for the 5D MKII release. Other cameras supported are as follows:

  * Canon EOS 5D Mark II
  * Canon PowerShot G10
  * Panasonic DMC-G1
  * Panasonic DMC-FX150
  * Panasonic DMC-FZ28
  * Panasonic DMC-LX3
  * Leica D-LUX 4
I am hoping to get my hands on a 5D MK II before I go to New York on the 6th Dec, but with the way things are going, its looking less and less likley. <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
