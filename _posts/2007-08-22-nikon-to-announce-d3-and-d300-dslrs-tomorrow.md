More rumors, but considering the last one [i posted about the 40D][1] actually [came true][2], we see what happens here. Nikon may announce 2 new cameras tomorrow: a D3 and a D300. Specs below. [Via Engadget]

D3 

  * Full frame (FX) 12 megapixel Nikon CMOS 
      * Live view LCD 
          * 9fps in FF mode, 11fps in HSC mode (at 1.5 crop factor / DX size) 
              * ISO 200 &#8211; 6400 with LO (ISO 100 equivalent), H1 and H2 (ISO 12800 / 25600, respectively) 
                  * 51 point autofocus system (15 cross sensor) </ul> 
                D300 
                
                  * DX format 12 megapixel CMOS (supposedly possibly the same as the D2X) 
                      * Live view LCD 
                          * 6fps, up to 8fps with power grip (no HSC mode) 
                              * ISO 200 &#8211; 3200 with LO (ISO 100 equivalent), H1 (ISO 6400) 
                                  * 51 point autofocus system (15 cross sensor) </ul> 
                                12MP is a bit low for the high end (the [1Ds Mark III][2] is now nearly double at 21), but 9FPS is good. [update] [Its Official][3]
