[check out this collection of high speed photos][1]. some very cool stuff in there. and in site update news, i am currently working on some cool things for the site. first is a new photo galery. i have been slaving over a semi cold keyboard and a hot cup of coffee for the last few weeks working on this, and hope to have a demo soon. there are other things too, like moving the blog to a different system (currently using [blogger][2]) but i am thinking of writing my own engine, and importing all my old posts. thats the most important thing. more stuff soon, but just to get that out there.
