Cannon has just announced the new Canon 1D-X: A Full Frame, 18MP camera, which shoots at 14FPS JPEG (12 RAW), Has an ISO of 204,000, Gigabit Ethernet (yup. not a typo!) and can shoot video at 1080p at 24 (23.97), 25 or 30 fps, or 720p at 50 or 60 fps. Videos are now not limited to the 4Gb file size of the Older Canons (like my 5D MK II) but due to tax laws in the EU (never heard of this before.) the video is still capped at just under 30 min. The Price? $6800. Press release and more photos [at Engadget][2].

Also, Canon announced the release of a GPS addon (The GP-E1) for the 1DX as well as a 802.11N Wifi adapter (WFT-E6). photos below.Â  would like these to be backward compatible with my 5D MKII, but guessing they wont be. <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
