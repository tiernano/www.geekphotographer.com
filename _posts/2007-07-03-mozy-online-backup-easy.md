For the last few days i have been playing with [Mozy][1], an Online Backup service. Its pretty easy to install and setup: It has built in backup templates, and you just select the ones you want to use, and it just backs up in the background. And not only that, its FREE. Well, you get 2Gb of online storage, for nothing, or unlimited storage for $4.99 a month! Very cool stuff. Perfect for storing your most valued photos!
