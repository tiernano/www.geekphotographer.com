Since some of this site will be using Web2.0 features, and for the laugh also, i am thinking of using the following logos around the site. these will be over laid on the current images (of me in the mirror). Any thoughs? i havent done the overlay stuff just yet, because i dont want to spend time on that and find out it looks crap! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

So, here is the front page logo (click to see the full version):

<a href="http://lsnbackup.nfshost.com/newlogoswhatdoyouthink_E8E2/reflectTiernanOToolePhotographyBETA4.png" atomicselection="true"><img height="30" src="http://lsnbackup.nfshost.com/newlogoswhatdoyouthink_E8E2/reflectTiernanOToolePhotographyBETA_.png" width="240" /></a> 

and here is the one for the blog (again, click for full text):

<a href="http://lsnbackup.nfshost.com/newlogoswhatdoyouthink_E8E2/reflectTiernanOToolePhotographyBlogB.png" atomicselection="true"><img height="25" src="http://lsnbackup.nfshost.com/newlogoswhatdoyouthink_E8E2/reflectTiernanOToolePhotographyBlogB1.png" width="240" /></a> 

these where made with [this site][1].
