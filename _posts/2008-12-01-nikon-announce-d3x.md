Â ![D3X][1]

Nikon has [announced its new &#8220;Big&#8221; camera, the D3X][2] (pictured above). this thing is, from what i can gather, their answer to the 1D range. It does both Full Frame (at 24.5MP) and not so full frame (10MP) and can shoot at 5FPS in full frame mode and 7 in not so full frame. interesting party trick! Its not cheap, at about $8k, but it is a pro grade camera&#8230; Mind you, as a Canon guy, i will take a 5D MK II any day!
