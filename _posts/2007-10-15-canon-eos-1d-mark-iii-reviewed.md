The guys and girls over at DigitalCameraInfo.com have just posted a [review of the Canon EOS 1D Mark III][1]. This is one hell of a camera, shooting at 10 frames a second! This is one sweet camera. Note: be careful on their site. they have those inbetween page ads, which are just annoying, and nearly made me decide not to post this link, but because its this camera, I have to post it. By the way, this is a different camera to the [1D-s Mark III][2]. Thats the full frame, 21.1 MP camera, which shoots at 5FPS. this is the 10mp camera, shooing at 10fps, but not so full frame. Still sweet!
