I have seen a few of these &#8220;HDR&#8221; photos around, but never actually figured out how to take them or make them. Well, hopefully, with the help of [this tutorial over at Backing Winds][1], I will have some HDR photos for you to check out later on. And if not, at least you have the tutorial! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
