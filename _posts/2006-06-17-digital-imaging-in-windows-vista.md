If you a geek like me, and your trying out [Windows Vista B2][1], why not [see how cool it is for photography][2]? since i am shooting in RAW all the time, i cannot make the full move to Vista, just yet, but once my photos are converted to JPEG i do copy them and play with Vista. RAW Support will be in the release version of Vista, so i will be playing with that.
