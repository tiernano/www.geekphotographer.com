A question on the Inside Aperture blog made me think: [Do Aperture users need Photoshop][1]? Well, that was their question, and mine was, photowhat?! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> I haven't needed to use Photoshop in a while. Aperture does all I need it to do. I suppose I don't need to do half the stuff the author of the post does, which makes me wonder if I am missing something. Should I bite the bullet and try out Photoshop? is it something I should spend time learning? Comments welcome, now that they work well! <img src="http://www.geekphotographer.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
