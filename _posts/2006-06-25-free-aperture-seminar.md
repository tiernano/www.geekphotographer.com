I use Apple's [Aperture][1] in my RAW image workflow, and it is very cool. Check out this [post over at ApertureTricks][2] with info on a free Online Aperture seminar showing you some interesting things you can do with Aperture. The Blurb: 

*See how to work in RAW format as easily as with JPEG, without intermediate conversions.

Learn how to find the best shots using intuitive compare-and-select tools and a full-screen workspace for comparing multiple images.

Discover how to adjust and color-correct imagesâ€”without altering a single pixel in the original photos.

Examine the flexible organizational tools, comprehensive metadata support, and powerful search tools for finding shots quickly.

Watch how to instantly create contact sheets, print to a local printer, or order color-managed prints online.
