There has been some rumors about a new Sigma Lens, an 18-35mm F1.8. Well, Sigma have confirmed its true. More details are on [F-Stoppers here][2], but the problem that i see, and F-Stoppers have seen also, is that its only for APS-C cameras, not full frame. Up to that point, I was thinking this was going to be my next lens. That detail just put the Kaibosh on it.
