So, as you probably know, i am a Canon Guy... I have had a good few since i started shooting, and well, i am happy with them. My main shooter is currently a 5Ds, and i have a [5D MK II](https://www.geekphotographer.com/5d-mkii-review-round-up/) as a backup and a plan of possibly getting a [5D MK IV](https://www.geekphotographer.com/Canon5DMKIV/) soon... Anyway, that being said, Nikon have announced their latest camera, the D850, and, well, after reading the sepecs, it sounds interesting...

So, first, specs:

* 45.7 MP CMOS

* ISO from 64 - 25,600, expandable to 32-108,400

* 4K Video at up to 30FPS, 1080p @ 120FPS.

* 8K in-camera time lapse

* 7 FPS body only (9 with a battery grip)

* 153 point AF system

* SD and XQD card slots

* Wifi and Bluetooth, no GPS

So, not having much knowledge about previous Nikons, and thinking (based on the price of $3296.95 [BHPhoto pre order](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1351688-REG/nikon_d850_dslr_camera_body.html)) it seems to be somewhere between a 5D MK4 and a 5Ds. MK4 is around the same price, but less MP, same FPS (without battery grip) and shoots 4K Video. the 5Ds, on the other hand, has it beat on MP, does not shoot 4K Video, and shoots slower FPS. But, I think the D850 is aiming at the MK4, not the 5Ds... So, based on that, it will be interesting to see the reviews.

So, with that, i will leave the usual links to other sites who know what they are talking about.
