this is not the first time Casio has done something crazy with a Hi speed camera. the [last one shot at upto 60FPS][1]! this new one, the [EX-FH20][2], however, shoots at 40FPS at 7.1MP (mind you, only for up to 40 frames&#8230;) and can record movies at 1000FPS!!! thats just mad. its not that expencive either: Â£399, which for this kind of FPS aint bad! just wondering how log after shooting 40 frames in 1 second do you have to wait before you can start again. Also, of interest, is the fact it shoots DNG images too. nice touch.
