I have just recieved a free Encyclopaedia Britannica subscription because i run a blog, and since this blog is photography based, i though i would test it out with a link to the [The Technology of Photography][1].

The way it works is if you are someone who publishes to the web on a regular occation, like a blogger, you can get a [free subscription][2] and post links on your site. Very cool stuff. the link above is quite lengthy and very informitive, but, say you just want info on [SLR cameras][3]Â thats posible too! Thanks [Encycolpaedia Britannica!][4]
