Using only some sticky tape and an old pair of glasses, this tutorial over Photojojo shows you [how to build a FishEye lens][1] for your SLR and DSLR. Very cool stuff. Now looking into doing this. i have seen some very nice shots with Fish Eye lenses. A Friend of mine in work [took some shots][2] at the WRC event in Sligo, and there are some amazing photos.
