The Canon 400D is only out a couple of weeks (if even that) and there is already a review [here at Camera Labs.com][1]. [[via PhotoBlog][2]] And while reading photoblog, i found [this post about a Canon 3d][3], which is all rumors. not sure if its real, but looks nice. Cross between a 5D and a 1D by the looks of things!
