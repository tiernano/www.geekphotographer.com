I never really likes Adobe Photoshop. Too bulky for what i wanted. Thats why i love Aperture. Everything is a lot easier and quicker (well, depends on your defination of quicker) then photoshop. But, anyway, this article over at Oreilly&#8217;s Inside Aperture goes into some of the new things in [CS3 and what they mean for Aperture users][1]. Check it out.
