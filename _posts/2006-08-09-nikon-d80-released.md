[the digital photography blog has some info about the new, just released Nikon D80][1]. Looks interesting. personally, i am a canon man, but this has some nice features, like the 3FPS for 100 frames (33 seconds continuios shooting!) and the SD and SD-HC card format (SD-HC is a new SD format, faster with more storage). not sure about CF support though&#8230;
