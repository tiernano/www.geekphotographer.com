Ok, this is only a prototype, but this sounds mental. a [60 FPS 6MP camera][1], which can shoot at up to 300FPS at VGA quality. <strike>no info on what storage is used (it would want to be very large storage)</strike>. some maths: 6mp JPG photo weighs in at, roughly, 2mb. just an estimate. 2mb * 60FPS = **120MBYTES/SECOND**! Since the fastest CF Cards are writing at around 40MB/S, it would mean you would need one hell of a buffer in the camera, and would only be able to shoot for, say, about 4 seconds if your buffer is 512mb. maybe 7 seconds before your buffer fills and cant write any more to the card. 

Thing is, since your shooting at that amount of data, its going to be a nightmare for editing shots! It defiantly sounds cool, don't get me wrong (3 x the quality of High Def video) but there will be a need for some serious compression, serious processing, and serious storage. and then serious hardware on the backend when processing this at home!

[updated] [Engadget now have a hands on with the camera][2]. they also say it shoots to SDHC, and should be available around 2008. they also have a photo gallery.
