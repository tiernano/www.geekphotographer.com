On Episode 94 of The Grid,Â Tom Hogarty from Adobe [previewed RAW image processing on a Tablet][1], specifically an iPad 2. Now, an iPad 2 is pretty outdated at this stage, but the video shows it making edits to the images fairly quickly and effortlessly. This sounds like an interesting prospect, but I think there is something very missing&#8230;

First, he showed (starting around the 17min mark) a demo of a prototype app for the iPad which allows editing of RAW images on the iPad. Now, i have not fully watch this video (its 50+ min long, and I hope to get around to watching it over the weekend) but it looks like the processing is done in &#8220;The Cloud&#8221;. This is an interesting idea, since you can offload all the processing to a faster machine somewhere, and do not have to worry. If Adobe get faster machines for faster processing in a few months, you get the automatic benefit, or at least in theory you do&#8230;

Anyway, with that comes a question: How do you get the image to the Cloud in the first place? My 5D MKII shoots 25MB RAW images. the Demo uses a 5D MKIII, which is about the same size. On an Average HSDPA Connection, you could be talking a Minute (25MB RAW uploading at about 4mbits/s gives 50 seconds) for just one photo&#8230; Thats assuming you have a full 4mb/s connection (HSDPA can reach about 6, give or take, and 4G is faster, but still&#8230; not everyone will have these speeds).

Also, as a second issue, If you are uploading, editing and working on photos this large, what happens to your bandwidth bill? I get 10Gb of data on my 3G modem at the moment&#8230; if there is a lot of data being sent between the Cloud and my device, that can go very quickly&#8230;

I do like this idea, do not get me wrong, i just wonder how Adobe will, or even if they can, manage the bandwidth requirements&#8230;
