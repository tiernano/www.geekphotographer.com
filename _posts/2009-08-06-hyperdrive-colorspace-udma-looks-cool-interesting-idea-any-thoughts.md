So, i have been looking at this [ColorSpace UDMA][1] backup device, and i am thinkingâ€¦ I shoot on CF Cards. i carry 24Gb of them with me most of the time. I also sometimes carry my Laptop (MacBook Pro). But i like the look of this because of the ability to not only backup your CF Cards, but to back the internal drive itself up to somewhere else (other external USB Drive). This sounds very handy for long trips, large events, etc. 

But, there is a question: Is it any good? Anyone play with one of these? Recommendations? Especially around using with Lightroom?
