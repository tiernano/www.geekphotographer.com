I am not a Nikon guy. I like Canon cameras, since I have one, and a lot of my friends (who are in to cameras) have Canons. But if I only posted about Canon cameras, I would not be a very good photography blogger, now would I?

Anyway, found this [Preview over at Digital Photography Review on the new Nikon D3][1]. I looks very 1D-ish, does between 9 and 11 frames a second, 12mp, and something interesting, you can switch between Cropped and Full Frame. Interesting.
