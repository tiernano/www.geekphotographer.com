Well, if your hitting this site directly with your Phone, Tablet or PC 
(and not an RSS reader) you can see its been changed... I have moved 
from [Wordpres][1] to [Jekyll][2]. all the content is static, all the 
pages generated well ahead of time and all the site should be a lot 
faster! I wrote up details about [how i did this on my other blog][3] 
and the same is done on this one. So, what do you think? You like?
