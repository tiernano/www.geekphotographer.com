So, over the next few weeks, I will be working on the reboot of the GeekPhotographer website. The blog will still exist, probably in a different location, and so will the [photo galleries][1], but what they will be hosting and where will be a big change. I have some ideas around the gallery software. Currently I am using [SmugMug][2] as my host, I am thinking of building my own service, mainly just for me, as a skills development project. There is nothing wrong with SmugMug. they will still be used while i am building my own site, but as i said, this is a technically exercise, so I want to build this myself. I will post more about that on my more technical blog. The content of this site will also change slightly. Since this site is for geeks who are also photographers, or the other way round, I will be posting more on technical stuff: digital workflow, backup and archiving, sites to help show off your photos, etc. I may post links to camera reviews also. If there is anything in particular you would like to see on the site, please ask! The more ideas, the more content I can create for you. You can send requests to [@geekfotog][3] on Twitter, or leave a comment below.
