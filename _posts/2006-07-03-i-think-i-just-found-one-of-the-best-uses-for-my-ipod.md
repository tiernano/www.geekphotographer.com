I am currnently using a powerbook for all my photography needs because of Apple's Aperture. but my current problem is i havent got a lot of network storange for all my photos (currently hitting the 20Gb mark). the powerbook has hit a limit on storage too (currently got a 60Gb disc and only has about 8b free). so i am currently using my 60Gb black video iPod as a external HDD for backing up my Aperture valut, which works well. i still need proper network backup storage, but it wont be for a few months. just a bit of useless info for you there.
